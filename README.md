# Jupyter_numpy_pyplot

> author: [Tangqi Feng](https://tangqifeng.github.io/)

These are solutions Solutions to the [Jupyter problem sheet](https://github.com/TangqiFeng/Jupyter_numpy_pyplot/wiki/Problem-set:-Jupyter,-pyplot-and-numpy). 

These problems relate to [Jupyter](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html), [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html), and [pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html).

## Components
* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)(an interactive computing environment that enables users to author notebook documents that include:)
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) (a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension [NumPy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy).)

## How to run?
go to the repository folder, open the command-line interpreter or terminal(mac), 

type: ``` $ jupyter notebook ```

then, click *Fisher's_Iris.ipynb* on browser which opened automatically

**Before you run the project, mack sure all needed components are installed:**
* [python3](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python)
* Jupyter, numpy and matplotlib use pip install:

```bash
$ pip install Jupyter/numpy/matplotlib 
```
* [Fisher's Iris](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/gh-pages/data/iris.csv)
* (maybe) [python3_tk](https://www.howtoinstall.co/en/ubuntu/xenial/python3-tk) for ubuntu
